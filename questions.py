        "Sophia is working with different number bases and wants to convert a given integer to its base 7 representation. Write a function that takes an integer 'n' and returns a string representing its base 7 equivalent.     (BASE 7)",
        "Finn is working with binary search trees and wants to transform a given BST into a greater tree. In this new tree, each node’s value is replaced with the sum of all values greater than or equal to that node’s value in the original BST. Write a function that takes the root of a BST and returns the root of the transformed tree.     (CONVERT BST TO GREATER TREE)",
        "Eli is sorting his toy collection based on his friend's preferred order. Given two arrays, where one array represents the preferred order of items and the other array contains the items Eli wants to sort, write a function that sorts the items according to the preferred order. If some items are not in the preferred order array, they should be sorted at the end in ascending order.     (RELATIVE SORT ARRAY)",
        "Olivia is analyzing the performance of a stock over a period of time and wants to calculate the sum of the stock prices over different ranges. Write a class 'NumArray' that initializes with an array of integers and supports a 'sumRange' method that returns the sum of elements between two given indices, inclusive.     (RANGE SUM QUERY - IMMUTABLE)",
        "Liam is analyzing an array and wants to find an index where the sum of all the numbers to the left of the index is equal to the sum of all the numbers to the right. Write a function that takes an array of integers and returns the pivot index. If no such index exists, return '-1'.     (FIND PIVOT INDEX)",
        "Harper is learning how to tell time using a binary watch, where the LEDs on the watch represent the hour and minute. Each watch can display multiple possible times depending on how many LEDs are on. Write a function that takes the number of LEDs that are on and returns all possible times the watch could display.     (BINARY WATCH)",
        "Mia lives in a small town where everyone trusts the town judge. The judge trusts no one, and everyone else trusts the judge. Given an array of trust relationships between people in the town, write a function that finds the judge (if one exists) and returns their number. If no judge exists, return '-1'.     (FIND THE TOWN JUDGE)",
